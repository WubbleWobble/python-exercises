from typing import List

def double(numbers: List) -> List:
    # Write code here so that the assertion below is satisfied
    
    # Hint: Use a for loop (Further hints below, if needed)
    pass

input = [2, 3, 8]
actual = double(input)

assert actual == [4, 6, 16]






































# Hint: 
#   a) Make a new list
#   b) Use a for loop to visit each element in "numbers"
#   c) Add the desired values to the new list
#   d) Return the new list

# Comment: There's a more compact way to do this, but the
#          intention here is to practise the basics!
